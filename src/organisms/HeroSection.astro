        And... I lived in Japan for eight years and I can speak the language fairly
        well. I have also traveled to Australia, Hong Kong and Korea. Traveling is
        something I like to talk about, but really I like to talk about anything,
        from politics to cooking or anything in between. I like to let my students
        come up with the topics they want to talk about.<br /><br />
