        <p>
          I am a third generation teacher from the state of Texas. That is to
          say my grandfather was a teacher; my father is a teacher and I am a
          teacher. And we were all licensed in the state of Texas.
          <br /><br />My degree is in Theater and licenses are in Theater and
          History. However, because my family owns and operates its own school I
          have had the opportunity to teach various subjects. Among them were
          Drafting and Computer Aided Drafting, Reading, Writing, History (World
          and U.S.), Geography, Theater and Basic Japanese.
          <br /><br />I have also taught English as a Second Language (ESL) in
          my family school and also in various schools in Tokyo.
